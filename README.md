# Blackjack

A close friend of mine is currently learning how to program at a bootcamp and their first assignment was to create a game from a list of choices. Although their requirement was to create a game in a browser window, I thought it would be fun to create a terminal only, 1-player version of Blackjack. It's not perfectly optimised, though I'm pretty happy with what I've got here, That's all this is, enjoy.

Please note that this is only a package so I could have a test runner and polyfill a browser's prompt in console.

## Things I'd consider changing

- Possibly creating a few different files to separate the types of actions to make it more readable.
- Allowing for multiple players.
- Making a browser version and doing all the CSS and that jazz.
